# Did it in C

This repository exists to expand my personal abilities. I have never had a
reason to learn C properly. This will be my effort to implement some algorithms
and data structures in C.

I'm sure as I go along, I will learn more about C idioms and best practices, so
this will serve as a record of all my mistakes and progress.

## Implementations

- Hello World

## Things I Learned

- How to write a simple Makefile
- How to organize header files
